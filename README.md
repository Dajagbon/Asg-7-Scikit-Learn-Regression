# Asg-7-Scikit-Learn-Regression

The gradient boosting regressor model performs best among the models in my script. It has the best mean squared error and r-squared score. The gradient boosting regressor has a mean squared error of 2898.4. For mean squared error, a score close to 0 is conisdered good. A perfect model would have an MSE of 0, but this is rarely achievable in real-world applications. The gradient boosting regressor model has a r-squared score of 0.4529. A weak performance r2 score is Below 0.5. It might be useful for rough predictions, but the model isn't capturing much of the underlying pattern.
